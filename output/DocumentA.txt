The ancient city of Veridia stood quiet at dawn, wrapped in a pale silver mist that drifted down from the mountains.
For centuries, scholars, travelers, and wanderers had passed through its gates in search of wisdom.
Today, the streets were almost empty, except for a few merchants setting out their wares along the narrow stone roads.

The river that flowed through Veridia reflected the rising sun like a ribbon of molten gold.
Birds perched on the towers of old libraries, carrying small pieces of parchment, as though they wished to read the words written inside.

Among all the scrolls stored in Veridia, one was whispered about more than any other—the Chronicle of Lost Paths.
It was said to contain a map that revealed the secret passages beneath the world, connecting forgotten kingdoms.

Chapter I: The Awakening of the Archive
---------------------------------------
In the oldest library hall, Master Arvel walked slowly between towering shelves.
Dust floated around him, soft as snow, illuminated by long beams of morning light.
He carried an oil lamp, though the sun was already brightening the wooden floors.

"Strange," he whispered. "The manuscripts feel restless today."

He reached the farthest shelf, where the Chronicle of Lost Paths was believed to rest.
Instead, he found a different scroll—one wrapped with a crimson ribbon that he had never seen before.

Chapter II: The Message Left Behind
-----------------------------------
Arvel unrolled the scroll carefully.
Inside it were lines written in an unfamiliar script, curving like rivers flowing through mountains.
But the center of the scroll contained a repeated phrase:

"middlepartlongestsubstringmiddlepart"

He stared at the repeated phrase, recognizing it from tales told by traveling historians.
They believed it was a key phrase that unlocked the hidden archives beneath Veridia.

Outside the library, the morning had turned into a soft, warm afternoon.
Children played near the river, and travelers crossed the old stone bridge that connected the upper and lower quarters of the city.

Chapter III: A Visitor from the North
-------------------------------------
Later that day, a cloaked figure approached the library gates.
Arvel saw him and frowned.
Visitors rarely came at this hour unless they carried urgent news.

The stranger spoke softly.
"I seek the Chronicle. I believe the paths are waking again."

Arvel hesitated but nodded.
He led the visitor into a quiet chamber lined with candles.
There, he placed the mysterious scroll on an oak table.

The stranger leaned close and whispered,
"The phrase you found—middlepartlongestsubstringmiddlepart—appears in ancient northern tablets."

Arvel’s eyes widened.
"Then the stories are true."

Chapter IV: Echoes Beneath the City
-----------------------------------
As the sun set, the two descended a spiral staircase hidden behind a tapestry.
The air grew colder with every step.

At last, they reached a stone door carved with strange patterns.
The repeated phrase appeared again:

"middlepartlongestsubstringmiddlepart"

The door opened with a low rumble.

Behind it lay a corridor filled with glowing runes.
The stranger stepped forward.
"It begins."

For hours they explored chamber after chamber, discovering etched symbols, old maps, wooden lockboxes, and paintings depicting forgotten kingdoms.

In the final chamber, they found a tall pillar with an inscription repeating endlessly:

"middlepartlongestsubstringmiddlepart"

Arvel touched the pillar and felt it pulse like a heartbeat.

Chapter V: A New Journey
------------------------
By dawn, they emerged from the underground halls, exhausted but enlightened.
The city was still sleeping.
The stranger removed his hood and said:

"Arvel, the Chronicle is not a book. It is a journey only a few can walk."

Arvel nodded.
Veridia was waking again, and so were its secrets.

And so the two set off for the northern mountains, where more mysteries awaited them.
Their path was uncertain, but the phrase that echoed in their minds gave them courage:

"middlepartlongestsubstringmiddlepart"
